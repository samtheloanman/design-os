# Custom Mortgage and Real Estate (CMRE)

## Description
A modern, conversion-focused redesign of custommortgageinc.com that preserves the proven homepage structure while elevating trust, clarity, and mobile usability. The site scales 179+ loan programs and 50+ locations with consistent templates, integrates Floify and callback workflows, and uses subtle, professional motion to guide borrowers and partners toward applications and callbacks.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Dated Visual Design
Current design fails to convey trust and professionalism. Modernize spacing, typography hierarchy, card patterns, and consistent CTA styling using the established brand palette while maintaining recognizable layout patterns users already know.

### Problem 2: Inconsistent Program and Location Templates
Program pages and location pages lack consistent structure and hierarchy across 179+ programs and 50+ locations. Build scalable content templates with consistent sections (eligibility, timeline, FAQs, CTAs, related content) so every page feels cohesive.

### Problem 3: Friction in Application and Lead Capture
Application and lead capture flows have unclear next steps and multiple friction points. Streamline CTA hierarchy, integrate Floify, create clear callback alternative, and explain expectations after submission.

### Problem 4: Poor Mobile Experience
Mobile experience is cluttered and hard to scan with deprioritized CTAs. Restructure for mobile-first layout, prioritize CTAs, make territories table searchable/collapsible, and reduce cognitive load.

### Problem 5: Underutilized Social Proof
Social proof (funded loans, testimonials) exists but is not a structured trust engine. Build a modern Funded Loans gallery with filters (loan type, location, property type), showcase funded deals with deal stories, and integrate reviews/testimonials into key pages.

### Problem 6: Unclear Realtor and Partner Value
Realtor/partner value proposition and referral workflow are unclear or buried. Create a dedicated partner portal section that clarifies the referral process, partner benefits, and resources.
