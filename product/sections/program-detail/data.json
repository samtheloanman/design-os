    "whatAre": "<p>FHA mortgages are loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration. When you take out an FHA loan, the lender is protected by federal insurance if you default on the loan. This federal backing allows lenders to offer more favorable terms to borrowers who might not otherwise qualify for conventional loans.</p><p>The government doesn't actually loan you money—private lenders do. The FHA simply insures the loan, which makes borrowers with less-than-perfect credit eligible for homeownership.</p>",

Borrowers with scores between 500-579 can qualify with a 10% down payment, but rates will be higher.</p><h4>Can I get an FHA loan with a bankruptcy on my credit?</h4><p>Yes! FHA loans are very forgiving. You can qualify 2 years after a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge or 1 year after a Chapter 13 bankruptcy begins.</p><h4>What are FHA mortgage insurance premiums?</h4><p>Upfront mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP) is typically 1.75% of the loan amount. Annual mortgage insurance premium (MIP) varies based on down payment and loan amount.</p><h4>Can I use FHA for investment properties?</h4><p>No, FHA loans are only for primary residences. The property must be your main home.</p>",
